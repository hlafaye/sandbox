# Hugo’s Sandbox

A collection of internal tools, pilots, and experimental products focused on
**data processing, operational dashboards, and business automation**.

This repository serves both as a **technical sandbox** and a **showcase** of
production-ready approaches for building internal tools quickly and cleanly.

## 🚀 Projects

### Pilote Innovorder
A billing and reporting pilot designed to accelerate sales recaps, data parsing,
and operational reviews for finance and support teams.

**Key features**
- CSV import from Innovorder exports
- Dictionary-driven configuration (no hard-coded logic)
- Output presets based on business parameters
- Procedural generation of reports and tables
- CSV / XLSX export per table
- Global recap line for fast visual consistency checks

---

### Other Experiments
- Business dashboards (KPIs, sales, costs, gaps)
- Data cleaning & normalization pipelines
- Internal tools & lightweight SaaS MVPs
- Responsive UI / UX prototypes

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

This sandbox focuses on:
- **Speed over over-engineering**
- **Configurability over rigid logic**
- **Readable code and simple data flows**
- **Tools built for real operational needs**

Most projects start as pilots and evolve only if they prove useful.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
- Backend (when applicable): Python, Flask
- Data: CSV, Excel (XLSX), dictionary-driven configs
- UI: Dark theme, responsive, mobile-first
- Deployment: GitHub Pages (static demos)

---

## 🌍 Internationalization

The site is developed **English-first**.
A French version is added progressively using a lightweight JS-based i18n
layer (JSON dictionaries).

---

## 📦 Deployment

The English version is deployed via **GitHub Pages** from the `main` branch.

Future features (translations, experiments) are developed in separate branches
before being merged into production.

> This repository is a sandbox: ideas evolve, pilots iterate, and not every
experiment is meant to become a finished product.
